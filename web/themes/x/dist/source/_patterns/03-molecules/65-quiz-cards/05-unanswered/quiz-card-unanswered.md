title: Quiz card unanswered
---
When presented with a quiz component, each question card has three potential states. The default state is "unanswered",
which includes a circular image, a title, and some descriptive text. It is shown when the slider is in its default (middle) state, and has a white triangular background affixed to the top.

The header text in this molecule is often another question that mirrors the larger question text above.
