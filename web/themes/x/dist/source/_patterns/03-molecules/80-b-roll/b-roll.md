title: B-roll

This molecule is used on special landing pages that use the b-roll hero component. It consists of cover images and videos for both mobile and desktop, since they have different aspect ratios.

The javascript for this element checks the window width, and then delivers the appropriate assets. The cover image is shown until the HTML5 video us ready, at which point it plays on a loop.
