title: Section heading
---
This element is used to display a section. It is often used within an embeddable, as there the background color of the
embeddable can influence the look of this element. 

Please see the comments at the top of the Twig output for configuration information about this element.

NOTE: The inverse variation of this is set on a yellow background purely for styleguide demo purposes. Any background color will be applied by a higher level element in real life.
