A element that places a branded right-angle triangle in the top-right corner of an element. Within the element is a triangle is an icon.


You would use this element when you wished to decorate a box to give it a little more pazzazz. This element is purely visual candy. This element is largely driven by em units, so it
can be sized using the font size of its container. 


As for December 2018, the only usage of this element is in the [question](/?p=viewall-components-question) component.


NOTE: The container that this element is used within needs to have relative positioning set.
