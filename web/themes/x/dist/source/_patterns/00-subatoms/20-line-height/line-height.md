title: Line height
---
These demonstrate our line height options. To alter these value you can modify the `$line-height` map in `x.tier-1.scss`.

You should not use these values directly in a component, as these are Tier 1 values.

NOTE: For styleguide visual purposes a bottom margin has been added to the text display, this is not part of the line height style, as such.
