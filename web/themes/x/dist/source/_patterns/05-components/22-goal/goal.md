title: Goal
---
This component is used as content for the [goals slider](/?p=components-goals). It consists of a title that is separated with a horizontal rule from the subtitle and description text.
A square image is aligned to the left. As the viewport is sized down, the text overlaps with the image until it disappears completely on mobile.
