title: Stories
---
This component is an example of a **slider** that is generally used on the homepage.
The stories slider has a [unique navigation element](/?p=molecules-pager-list-1) along the bottom in addition to the usual arrows on the side of the element. Like [testimonial](/?p=components-testimonial) and [quote](/?p=components-quote),
if has a styleized quotation mark aligned to the left. It also has a textured world map which is used as a background image. Unlike some other sliders on Rescue.org, "stories"
does not simply stack on mobile. Rather, we present users with larger "dot" navigation.
