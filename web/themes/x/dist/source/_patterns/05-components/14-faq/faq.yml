          paragraph_text: "Since 2011, the war in Syria has taken well over 400,000 lives and left 13.1 million people in need of aid, including 5.6 million with acute needs. Over two-thirds of Syrians live in extreme poverty. Through programs coordinated by our teams based in Iraq and Jordan, the IRC provides emergency and long-term services to displaced families and Syrians who have stayed in their homes."
