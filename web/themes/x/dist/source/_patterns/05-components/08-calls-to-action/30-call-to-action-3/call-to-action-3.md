title: Call to action 3
---
This Call to action 3 component has an art-directed background image that is wide and rectangular on larger devices, but becomes vertical on mobile devices.

On desktop devices the text is centered, but on mobile devices the text is vertically aligned to the bottom of the image.

Due to the nature of the change in aspect ratio, editors will have to be especially careful when choosing an image for this component. The text over the image is always white, as well, which means lighter images may not look as good.
