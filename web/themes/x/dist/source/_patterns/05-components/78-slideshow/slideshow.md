title: Slideshow

This component is an example of a **slider** that is currently only used both on landing pages and embedded within article pages.
Unlike other sliders, it has uniquely styled navigation arrows that overlap slightly with the image. There is a counter below the image that lets the user know how far along in the slideshow they are.
