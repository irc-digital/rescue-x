title: Goals
---
This component is an example of a **slider** that is currently only used on [Outcome](/?p=pages-outcome) pages.
It is usually placed on top of the page, and should have no more than 3 or 4 goal slides. It has a numbered pager on top in addition to the standard navigation arrows, and the slider itself is removed on mobile displays in favor of simple, stacked content.
