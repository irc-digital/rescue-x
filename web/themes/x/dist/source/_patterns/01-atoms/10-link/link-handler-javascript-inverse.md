title: Link (Javascript handler - inverse)
---
Infrequently used link variation. This causes the link handling to be done using javascript. The only reason to ever use this variation is if your link is already inside another link. This happens on one or two of our hero variations.


The link will be black with a black bottom border, when hovered the background color is white. This works well on a yellow background, but does not work at all on a white or black background.


Pass in `link_handler_javascript` set to `true` to use this variation.
