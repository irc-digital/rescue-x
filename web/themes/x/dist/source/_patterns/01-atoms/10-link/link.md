title: Link

Links support many variations of links across the library. Not every link on the site is made up of a link atom, but a lot are. If you wish to output a link then please consider using this atom first before just doing something custom.


Aside from links, please take a look at link icon, tweet link, icon-only link, convertible link button and, also, the button atom.


In general, link variations can be sized by their container. This is particularly handy for links within paragraphs. However, if you wish to have a link inside a regular component, rather than within rich text, you may wish to consider using one of the size modifier to output the link as a standardized size.


The standard link without any modifiers outputs a bold text link with a yellow underling that has a background color of yellow when hovered. 


Links are the most configurable element in this library - there are a lot of variations. Thankfully, aside from the variations there are very few other arguments that are needed. You may be able to combine modifiers in ways not outlined below, but do so at your own risk.



Links divide broadly into various types and within those types there are subtypes.  Our best advice is to look throuhg all the variations and find the one that suits your need and then look at the parameters needed to achieve that result.



NOTE: The <code>display-block</code> variation will display the link as an inline block. Like with other block level elements, if the link is not the last in its container it will receive some bottom margin too.
