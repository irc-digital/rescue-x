title: Link (Javascript handler)
---
Infrequently used link variation. This causes the link handling to be done using javascript. The only reason to ever use this variation is if your link is already inside another link. This happens on one or two of our hero variations.


The link will be black with a black bottom border, when hovered the background color is yellow. This works well on a white background, but does not work at all on a yellow or black background.


Pass in `link_handler_javascript` set to `true` and include `subtype-inverse` in the modifier array to use this variation.
