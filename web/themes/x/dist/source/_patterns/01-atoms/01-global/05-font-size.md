title: Font size
---
This is our base font information. To alter these value you can modify the `$font-size` map in `x.tier-1.scss`.

You should not use these values directly in a component, as these are Tier 1 values.

Note: Line heights have been applied to these font sizes just to make them render nicely in our styleguide.
