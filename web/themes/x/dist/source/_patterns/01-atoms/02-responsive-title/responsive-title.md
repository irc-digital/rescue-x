Based on the large heading typography treatment, except on larger screen (bigger than 980px) the text will get bigger or small based on the number of letters in the text.

This is handy to use when a page title is editorially controlled and can tend to both be short but also run long. 

You have to include the atom twig file in your component, as the twig file handles the length checking.
